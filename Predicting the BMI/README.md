# BMI_dataset
Predicting the BMI with help of various attributes.


About this file
A simple yet challenging project, to estimate the BMI based on the Gender, Height & Weight.
The complexity arises due the fact that dataset has less samples, & is highly imbalanced.
Can you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?

This data frame contains the following columns:

Gender : Male / Female
Height : Number (cm)
Weight : Number (Kg)
Index :
0 - Extremely Weak
1 - Weak
2 - Normal
3 - Overweight
4 - Obesity
5 - Extreme Obesity
Objective:
Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
Build classification models to predict the various categories of BMI.
Compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.
